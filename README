# grabsy.sh - # Change the default destination folder for os x screenshots.
# 
# USAGE
# sh grabsy.sh <DIRNAME> 
#       to make that the default destination for screenshots
# sh grabsy.sh
#       to revert to your default destination.  I didn't wanteit on the ~/Desktop, but you might.  Edit the config below.
# 
# you can edit your path so you dont have to type sh or ./ or whatever.
# I tested this in bash on os x mavericks.  it probably won't work anywhere else.
#
#
# Example:
#
# sh grabsy.sh DEMO
#
# This will create a new folder in ~/Documents/Screenshots/ called DEMO
# like this
# ~/Documents/Screenshots/DEMO
#
# Any screenshots you take using CMD+SHIFT+4 will save to DEMO.
#
# When you are done, you can run 
# sh grabsy.sh
#
# to revert your path to the default, well to my default which is ~/Documents/Screenshots
#
# I have ~/Desktop (the OSX default) in the script, but commented out.  you can edit that if you want to use it.
